# Logging - Part 2: Function Block Setup

### 1. Control Function Block:

The control [function block](../../vehicle-spy-main-menus/main-menu-scripting-and-automation/function-blocks/function-blocks-types/script-type-function-block.md) is a script that will tell the capture function block to change partitions when the trigger condition is met.  There are a number of ways to do this script.  The basic functionality would be to:\


1. Set your index
2. Wait for condition to change partition
3. Change partition
4. Make sure you are accessing a valid partition

The script in the example is shown below.&#x20;
