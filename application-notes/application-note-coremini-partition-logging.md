# Application Note: CoreMini Partition Logging

### Overview

This application note covers how to setup and configure a neoVI capable of standalone logging for Partition Logging.  Logging to partitions has the advantage of being able to capture more then one event to separate sections of the SD Card.  This can also be used to capture more than one pre post capture event on the hardware.\
\
In this application note, partitions on the card will be switched on receiving a specified message.  When this occurs, logging will continue but to a different section of the card.
