# Sample Replay Files

Below are links to files that were collected from an automobile or module subsystem. These files can be used to simulate bus traffic.

\*\*Note: You can replay any buffer you collect with Vehicle Spy; these are included here for your convenience.

To use these files, you must first save them to disk. To save, follow the steps listed below:

1. For Internet Explorer users, right click the link below and select "Save Target As..". For help users click the link.
2. Next a dialog will appear. Select to save it to your hard disk.
3. To replay the file, open Vehicle Spy, click on the Tools menu and then Options. In the window that opens, click on the Browse button and locate the replay file on your PC. Make sure the "Simulation Mode" check box is checked. Then start Vehicle Spy. (Notice that bus hardware setup can be done in this same window too.)
