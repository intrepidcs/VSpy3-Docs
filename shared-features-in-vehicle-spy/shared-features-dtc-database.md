# Shared Features: DTC Database

DTC information is stored in a separate database in Vehicle Spy. The DTC Database is simply a text file that lists the DTC number followed by the description of the problem. For an example, see the short list below. Once all the entries are made, save the file with a \*.TXT extension in the DTC folder located in the Vehicle Spy 3 directory.
