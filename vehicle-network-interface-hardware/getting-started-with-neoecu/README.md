# Getting Started with neoECU

The neoECU series of hardware provides a quick and low cost way to create a standalone ECU or gateway. Some common uses for neoECU devices could be:

* Gateway Applications: Move, copy, or translate messages from one network to another.
* Simulation: Create keep alive nodes or simulate vehicle traffic for other ECUs.
* Testers: Build automated testers or end of line testers.
* ECU Development: Quickly build and test new ECU logic.
* Other: neoECU devices can be used for a number of other tasks.

While different types of neoECU devices are available, the basics of creating scripts for the device remains the same.  Messages are created in the Messages Editor and scripts are created in Function Blocks.\

A number of different neoECU devices are available but CoreMini setups are put into the device in one of two ways; USB or CAN.  This depends on the device you are using.
