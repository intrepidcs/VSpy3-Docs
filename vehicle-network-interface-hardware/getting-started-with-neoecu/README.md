# Getting Started with neoECU

The neoECU series of hardware provides a quick and low cost way to create a standalone ECU or gateway. Some common uses for neoECU devices could be:

* Gateway Applications: Move, copy, or translate messages from one network to another.
* Simulation: Create keep alive nodes or simulate vehicle traffic for other ECUs.
* Testers: Build automated testers or end of line testers.
* ECU Development: Quickly build and test new ECU logic.
* Other: neoECU devices can be used for a number of other tasks.

While different types of neoECU devices are available, the basics of creating scripts for the device remains the same.  Messages are created in the [Messages Editor](../../vehicle-spy-main-menus/main-menu-spy-networks/message-editor/) and scripts are created in [Function Blocks](../../vehicle-spy-main-menus/main-menu-scripting-and-automation/function-blocks/).\

A number of different neoECU devices are available but CoreMini setups are put into the device in one of two ways; USB or CAN.  This depends on the device you are using.
