# Vehicle Network Interface Hardware: neoVI FIRE 2

**neoVI FIRE 2: 8x CAN FD, 4x LIN, Ethernet:DoIP/XCP**

Modern vehicle architectures are expanding to include Ethernet and CAN FD in addition to existing CAN and LIN networks. The neoVI FIRE 2 provides Ethernet, eight channels of CAN (including CAN FD) and four channels of LIN in one tool. All channels run simultaneously and are time-stamped in hardware. A fully-isolated high-speed USB interface allows messages to be sent and received without risk of damage to the PC.\
