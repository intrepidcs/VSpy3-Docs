# Vehicle Network Interface Hardware: neoVI RED

The neoVI RED Vehicle Interface from Intrepid Control Systems supports all of the following networks: 2xCAN (1 selectable: DWCAN, SWCAN, LSFTCAN) and 2xLIN or Keyword 2000/ISO9141. neoVI RED has the added benefit of being able to run standalone for running scripts and logging. Create Vehicle Spy 3 setups and download the setup in internal memory. Now you can test and log without a PC.

Vehicle network configuration is setup through neoVI 3G Explorer. Configuration files for running standalone are setup in Vehicle Spy 3. Click here for more information from the ICS website.
