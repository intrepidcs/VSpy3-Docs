# Vehicle Network Interface Hardware: neoVI FIRE

The neoVI **FIRE** Vehicle Interface from Intrepid Control Systems supports all of the following networks: 4x Dual Wire CAN, 1x Low Speed CAN, 1x Single Wire CAN, 1x J1850 VPW, 1x Keyword 2000/ISO9141, and 4x LIN. neoVI **FIRE** has the added benefit of being able to run standalone for running scripts and logging. Create Vehicle Spy 3 setups and download the setup in internal memory. Now you can test and log without a PC.

Vehicle network configuration is setup through neoVI 3G Explorer. Configuration files for running standalone are setup in Vehicle Spy 3. Click [here](https://intrepidcs.com/products/vehicle-network-adapters/neovi-red-2/) for more information from the ICS website.
