# Function Blocks Types

Vehicle Spy supports three types of Function Blocks:

* [Script Type](script-type-function-block.md): Lets you write a program consisting of a set of _command steps_ that control the operation of Vehicle Spy. You can use messages and signals as part of the script; for example, you could write a script to transmit a set of messages in response to receipt of an **Engine RPM** message. These are often called _function block scripts_.
* [Capture Type:](capture-type-function-block/) Captures messages and signals and logs them to a file, based on parameters you select. The recorded file can be used for playback, simulation or analysis. This function block type is also known as a _capture block_.
* [Playback Type](playback-type-function-block.md): Allows a data file to be played back through hardware. This is a quick way to set up a simulation for a node or vehicle. This type of function block is also called a _playback block_.

The type of block is selected at the time it is added by clicking the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/function\_block\_toolbar\_add.gif) button at the far left of the [toolbar](../function-blocks-toolbar.md). There you will see a small submenu appear, as shown in Figure 1, showing the three types. After you select the type of function block you want to create, it will be added to the [Function Block List](../function-block-list.md).

The type of function block chosen determines what is found in the setup area that comprises most of the function block window.
