# Script Type Function Block Command: Show Panel

### Command Description

This command allows a function block to display a panel in a [Graphical Panels](../../../../main-menu-measurement/graphical-panels/) window.

### Value Field Parameters

Double-click in the **Value** field to bring up a dialog box as shown in Figure 1, where you can select the graphical panel window and panel you want to show.

Note that most setups will only have a single window (called simply **Graphical Panels**) and many only have one panel as well (**Panel 1**).
