# Function Block List

Just below the Function Block Toolbar is a list of all the Function Blocks defined in the current setup. From this area each can be controlled and its activity monitored. A typical display of the function block list with three different blocks running can be seen in Figure 1.

### Header and Filter Rows

At the top of the Function Block List is a row with column headers describing the information below them. Immediately below this is a filter row, denoted by a set of ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/function\_block\_list\_filter.gif) symbols. Click on this symbol in the **Description**, **Type**, **Running** or **Status** fields to enter a filter that will allow you to restrict which function blocks are shown based on the values in the relevant cells.

### Columns

Table 1 contains a list of the columns found in the function block list and a description of each.
