# Function Blocks Toolbar

A number of essential tools are included in a row of buttons along the top of the [Function Blocks](./) area (Figure 1). These tools allow you to add function blocks, remove them, and perform other important operations.

**Note:** The **Add**, **Delete**, **Cut**, **Copy**, **Paste** and **Undo** commands are also available in a right-click menu in the [Function Block List](function-block-list.md).

### Adding Function Blocks

To add a new function block, click the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/function\_block\_toolbar\_add.gif) button at the far left of the toolbar. A small submenu will appear, as shown in Figure 2. Select the type of function block you want to add, and it will be added to the function block list with a default name (which you can customize).

### Searching Function Blocks

If you click the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/function\_block\_toolbar\_find.gif) button, Vehicle Spy will pop up a small dialog box to allow you to search for arbitrary text in any of your defined function blocks. At first, this dialog will only have a text box where you can enter the string to be found, with a blue arrow button you can click to start the search. Each press of the search button will display the next occurrence of the search string.\

Press the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/fb\_toolbar\_+.gif) button next to the word **Options** to expand the box,revealing more options as shown in Figure 3.

![Figure 3: Search Function Blocks dialog box.](../../../.gitbook/assets/function\_blocks\_search.gif)

The options are fairly self-explanatory, especially to anyone who has experience using a word processor:

* **Search Selected Block:** Vehicle Spy will only search the highlighted function block, as opposed to looking through all of them.
* **Case Sensitive:** Vehicle Spy will perform a case-sensitive search on the selected string.
* **Whole Word Only:** When checked, only whole words matching the string will be found; otherwise, partial matches will be included.
* **Direction:** Determines whether the search is done up or down through the function blocks.

Press the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/fb\_toolbar\_-.gif) button to hide these options, or click ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/function\_block\_toolbar\_find.gif) again to hide the entire search box.
