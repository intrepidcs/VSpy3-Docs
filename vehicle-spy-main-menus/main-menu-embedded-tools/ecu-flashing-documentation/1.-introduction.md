# 1. Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of ECU Flashing, highlighting the new advances in the field. ECU Flashing involves updating the software of a vehicle's ECU to enhance performance, add features, or address issues. In this document, we will cover the tools, processes, and requirements associated with ECU Flashing.

* **Remote/OTA -** ECU Flashing can be performed remotely over-the-air (OTA) for convenience and efficiency.
* **Standalone** - Standalone ECU Flashing allows for independent software updates without the need for external tools.
* **Parallel Flashers using VehicleSpy** - VehicleSpy enables parallel ECU flashing, accommodating up to 24 ECUs simultaneously.
* **ECU Flash Designer** - ECU Flash Designer provides a platform for designing and customizing ECU flashes.
* **ECU Flash Manager** - ECU Flash Manager is a tool for managing and coordinating ECU flashing activities.
* **Remote/OTA Generator** - The Remote/OTA Generator assists in creating and executing remote ECU flashing operations.
* **Custom Flasher Tool / EXE** - Custom Flasher tools in the form of EXE files offer flexibility and customization options.
* **ISO 14229/ISO 15765** - ISO 14229 and ISO 15765 are communication protocols used for ECU flashing and diagnostics.
* **SoAD (Service-Oriented Architecture for Diagnostics)** - SoAD is a framework for diagnostic communication between ECUs and external tools.
* **OEM Custom** - ECU flashing can be tailored to OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) specifications and requirements.
