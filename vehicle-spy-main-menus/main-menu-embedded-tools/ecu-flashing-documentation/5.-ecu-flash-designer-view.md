# 5. ECU Flash Designer View

Once you have your hardware connected, then you can go to the Embedded tools menu, ECU flashing and select ECU Flash Designer.&#x20;

ECU Flash Designer view allows you to configure the flash sequence for your ECUs using a multi selection tree view. &#x20;

Click plus icon to create a new ECU configuration sequence or click on the folder icon to your JSON ECU configuration sequence.&#x20;

In the sequence tree you can easily name different ECU, attach command sequence for ISO 1449, create sequence to read or write CAL and DiDs file, insert ISO 14229 ECU address to securely unlock the ECU, and enter CAN or CAN FD baud rate information. Once all information about the ECU sequence is added to our designer view, we are ready to flash the ECU. You can choose to generate a file for remote over the air flashing using Wireless neoVI server or go to ECU Flash Manager View by going to Embedded Tools Menu and selecting ECU Flashing.
