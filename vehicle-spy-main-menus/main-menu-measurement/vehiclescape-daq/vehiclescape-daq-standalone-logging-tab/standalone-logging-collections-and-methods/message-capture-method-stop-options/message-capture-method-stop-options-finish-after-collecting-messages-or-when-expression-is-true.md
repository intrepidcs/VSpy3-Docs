# Message Capture Method: Stop Options: Finish After Collecting Messages or When Expression is True

When using the Message Capture method for Standalone Logging within VehicleScape DAQ, selecting **Start immediately** or **Start when expression is true** for the Start Option causes the Stop Options to consist of two choices, as shown in Figure 1:

* **Finish after collecting # messages:** Stop logging when the specified number of messages has been collected after the Start trigger.
* **Finish when expression is true:** Stop logging when the selected expression is true; use the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/Functionbutton.gif) button to build the expression using the Expression Editor.
