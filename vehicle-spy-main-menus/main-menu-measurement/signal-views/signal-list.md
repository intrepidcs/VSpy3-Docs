# Signal List

Use the Signal List to display Vehicle Spy signal values in real time (Figure 1).

### Signal Groups

Like the [Signal Plot](signal-plot.md), the Signal List feature works with _signal groups_, or collections of signals. New groups are created by clicking on the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/add_signal_group.gif) button, while groups are removed by clicking the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/delete_signal_group.gif) button (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)). Signal groups are edited by clicking the **Select Signals** button and using the [Expression Builder](../../../shared-features-in-vehicle-spy/shared-features-expression-builder.md). To choose a different signal group, select it from the drop-down list to display signal values of that group in the list.

Note that the same signal groups are shared between the Signal List and [Signal Plot](signal-plot.md) features in Vehicle Spy.

### Signal List Controls

The forms button to the left of the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/add_signal_group.gif) button will open more Signal List windows. The Signal List font size can be increased and decreased by using the font size change buttons (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smTwo.gif)).

The main display area (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smThree.gif)) lists the selected signal group and the values of the associated signals. The short line in the **Update** column rotates each time the signal is updated.

Signals can be quickly removed using the right-click menu. Press/hold the keyboard shift or control keys and left-click to highlight signals, then right-click and choose **Remove Signals**.
