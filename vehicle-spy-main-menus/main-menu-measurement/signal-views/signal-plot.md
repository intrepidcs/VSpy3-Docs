# Signal Plot

Use the **Signal Plot** (Figure 1) to plot Vehicle Spy signals in real time.

![Figure 1: Plotting signals with the Signal Plot feature.](../../../.gitbook/assets/spySignalsviewLayout.gif)

### Signal Groups

The Signal Plot feature uses _signal groups_, or collections of signals, to plot. New groups can be created by clicking on the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/add\_signal\_group.gif) button, or removed using the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/delete\_signal\_group.gif) button (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)). Signal groups are edited by clicking the **Select Signals** button and using the Expression Builder. To choose a different signal group, select it from the drop-down list to display that group in the plot.

Note that the same signal groups are shared between the Signal Plot and Signal List features in Vehicle Spy.

### Signal Plot Controls

The **Plot Signals** button (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smTwo.gif)) creates another Signal Plot window. The **Logging** button (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smThree.gif)) opens the Logging view; logging status is displayed just below the button, as shown in Figure 1.

The Signal Plot tool bar (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smFour.gif)) provides various features for displaying and saving data. Table 1 describes each of the Signal Plot toolbar controls. The data plot is seen in the bottom section of the window (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smFive.gif)). The plot axes (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smSix.gif)) can be stretched or zoomed by clicked and dragging them.
