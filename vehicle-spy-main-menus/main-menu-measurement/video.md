# Video

Vehicle Spy's **Video** view can show and record live video from cameras connected to the PC. Various filters are provided to alter and analyze the video for the purposes of object detection and automated testing. Video view is opened from the [Measurement menu](./). Captured video must be reviewed using the [Video Tab](video.md).

### Overview

Follow these general steps to use the Video view in Vehicle Spy:

1. Choose and setup a camera for the PC.
2. Take Vehicle Spy online with licensed ICS hardware.
3. Add input filters to alter the video and reduce noise.
4. Add output filters to make calculations based upon the altered video.
5. Use [Graphical Panels](graphical-panels/graphical-panels-tools/)/Video and [Expression Builder](../../shared-features-in-vehicle-spy/shared-features-expression-builder.md)/Cameras to process the video calculations.

### Choosing a Camera Type

There are two supported camera types: Capture Device and Axis Network Camera. Capture Devices are local video devices such as USB webcams or built-in laptop cameras. Axis Network Cameras refer to a line of ethernet network cameras manufactured by AxisÂ® Communications which transmit Motion JPEG video over TCP.

Click **Add New Camera** (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)) to add a camera and select the appropriate type.

### Capture Device Setup

To begin using a capture device, click on **Device Name** in the upper right corner and select the camera from the list. If the camera does not appear on the list, verify it is connected to the PC and that Windows recognizes it. **Width** and **Height** should be set to the camera's video resolution, in pixels. After a camera is selected, start the live video by taking Vehicle Spy [online](../../basic-operation-of-vehicle-spy/running-and-stopping.md) with ICS hardware. Any brand-specific camera settings, if available, can be changed by clicking the cog wheel button labeled **Settings** after taking Vehicle Spy online.

### Axis Network Camera Setup

**Note**: Ethernet must be enabled in Vehicle Spy to communicate with Axis network cameras. To do this, go to the [Tools](../main-menu-tools/) -> [Options](../main-menu-tools/tools-options/), [Spy Networks tab](../main-menu-tools/tools-options/options-spy-networks-tab/) and check the box in the bottom left corner named "Use PC Ethernet interface.". Vehicle Spy must be restarted after changing the ethernet setting. If multiple Ethernet interfaces exist, use the [Logon](../../basic-operation-of-vehicle-spy/the-logon-screen.md) screen to select the interface connected to the camera.

To begin using the Axis network camera, enter its **IP Address** in the upper right corner. The default IP address for Axis cameras is 192.168.0.90. Note that the PC must be on the same subnet as the Axis network camera. Various settings can be changed like FPS (Frames Per Second), Compression, and Camera Number (if more than one). The Request URI text string should be set to /mjpg/video.mjpg. After the Axis camera is set up, start the live video by taking Vehicle Spy [online](../../basic-operation-of-vehicle-spy/running-and-stopping.md) with ICS hardware.

### General Layout and Use of the Video View

A tab for each camera is shown across the top. Live video from the chosen camera is shown on the left. A tree view along the right (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smTwo.gif)) has settings for the chosen camera and also shows the outputs of Calculation filters. **Expand** and **collapse** tree branches by clicking on the little triangles. **Add** items to the tree by clicking on their blue plus button. **Delete** items by clicking on their red X button. **Move** items up and down in the tree by clicking on their blue up and down arrows. Items can be added and edited at any time, but can be deleted and moved only if Vehicle Spy is offline.

Some inputs have a horizontal **on/off switch** on their right side to change between manual and [calculated signal](../../shared-features-in-vehicle-spy/shared-features-calculated-signal-editor/) modes. Some outputs have a **cog wheel** to open a dialog to change the format and units displayed across Vehicle Spy.

### Properties

The **Description** of the video stream changes the labels on the Video view tabs, Expression Builder/Camera sources, and Graphical Panels/Video tools.

Video filters will work while Vehicle Spy is running in simulation mode only if **Filters Enabled in Simulation Mode** is ON.

If **Logging** is enabled then each captured frame will be saved on the PC as a JPG image in a date stamped folder named "Video Capture" in the [Data directory](../main-menu-file/data-directory.md). This feature works only if Vehicle Spy is online with licensed ICS hardware.

### ROIs (Regions of Interest)

Regions of Interest can be used to apply filters only to a specific part of the image. Create an ROI by clicking the blue plus button next to the menu item labeled "ROIs". Change its dimensions using the Top, Left, Bottom, and Right fields, or by clicking and dragging on its corners in the video portion of the view. Filters added to the ROI will only affect the portion of the image covered by the ROI.

### Active and Available Filters

Filters are used to modify the video in real-time. **Active Filters** show which ones are currently being applied to the video. **Available Filters** lists all filters to pick from. To apply a filter, find it in the Available Filters branch then click on its blue plus button. The filter will get added to the Active Filter branch and applied immediately to the video.

Multiple filters can be added to change the entire video image and numerous ROI areas. As a result, be extra careful to verify the filters are on their correct branches because all of them are named Active Filters and Available Filters!

Active filters located higher up in the tree are applied BEFORE active filters located below them

Vehicle Spy uses the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) for its video filter algorithms.

### Recording Video Using Video View

The Video tab requires the correct VSB file and a folder named Video\Cam\_<1-8>\JPEG at the same location. Use the following steps to record video using Video view:

1. Verify ICS h/w and a camera are connected to the PC.
2. Verify ICS h/w is also connected to a physical network.
3. Verify ICS h/w has transmit or receive messages at a rate <= 10 ms.
4. On Video view, add a capture camera with **Logging** = ON.
5. Take VSpy online, capture some video for awhile, then go offline. See the Data directory has a new folder named Video Capture + date stamp\Cam\_1\JPEG.
6. Rename the "Video Capture " folder to just "Video".
7. On Messages view, manually [save the buffer](../main-menu-spy-networks/messages-view/messages-view-top-toolbar/save-the-buffer.md) as a VSB file.
