# Data Analysis

Data Analysis is a powerful tool for graphically displaying and analyzing the data in files collected from vehicle networks. It can be accessed through the Vehicle Spy Measurement menu.\
\
Data can come from a variety of sources, including buffer files, log files, and files obtained from Capture Type Function Blocks. These files are all typically found in the current user's Data Directory.

### Data Analysis View and Partitions

An example of the Data Analysis feature in Vehicle Spy can be found in Figure 1, which shows a single plotted signal. The view can be conceptually divided into four areas. On the top is a set of toolbars, and below that are three partitions:

* **Top Left:** Data files and channels are chosen here.
* **Top Right:** Shows plots and values of selected channels.
* **Bottom:** Contains a table listing data points in selected channels.

You can adjust the relative sizes of these partitions by dragging the vertical and horizontal divider bars that separate them, which are shaded in green in Figure 1.

### Data Analysis Toolbars

There are four toolbars, which appear at the top of the Data Analysis display in Figure 1. You may see a different default layout when you first open the feature, and not all toolbars may appear initially; they can be enabled or disabled via the Show menu.\
\
Notice that there are two vertical bars (![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/vertical\_bars.gif)) at the left edge of each toolbar. You can click on these bars, then drag and drop the toolbar to a different location.

### Data Analysis Areas

Table 1 contains information on the individual areas in the Data Analysis view. Each entry contains a description of the region, a reference to its location in Figure 1, and a clickable link to a page that describes it in detail.
