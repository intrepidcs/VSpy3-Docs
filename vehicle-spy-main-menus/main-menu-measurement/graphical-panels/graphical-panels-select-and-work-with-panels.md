# Graphical Panels: Select and Work With Panels

There are several features to help you work with the various panels that comprise a complete Graphical Panel application. These are controlled via a set of buttons located below the main toolbar; an example can be found in Figure 1.

Most of these buttons can also be accessed by right-clicking on any of the panel tabs to bring up a context menu (Figure 2). This menu also allows you to [delete](graphical-panels-add-or-delete-panels.md), [float](floating-panels.md) or [rename](graphical-panels-panel-properties.md) a panel.
