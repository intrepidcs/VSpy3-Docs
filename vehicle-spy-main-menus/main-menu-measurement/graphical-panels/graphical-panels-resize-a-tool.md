# Graphical Panels: Resize a Tool

To resize a tool, select it, then click and drag one of the four small square handles that appear in the corners (Figure 1). Changes to the dimensions will be shown in the **Width** and **Height** attributes of the [Properties](graphical-panels-tool-properties.md) tab. You can also set a tool's dimensions to precise values by editing those properties directly.\
\
A group of tools can be resized to have the same dimensions using the [format button](graphical-panels-format-align-or-resize-a-tool-group.md).
