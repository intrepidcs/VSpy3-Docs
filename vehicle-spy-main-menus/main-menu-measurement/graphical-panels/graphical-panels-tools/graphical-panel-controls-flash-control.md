# Graphical Panel Controls: Flash Control

The Flash control allows you to embed a Shockwave Flash object to customize the look and feel of a graphical panel. Vehicle Spy ships with several Flash controls that you can use as gauges and knobs in your panel setups; these are found in the **ICS Flash Files** subfolder under the main Vehicle Spy 3 install directory. Examples of these are shown in Figure 1.
