# Graphical Panel Controls: Grid

The Grid control is a quick and simple way to view multiple data elements in tabular fashion within a graphical panel (Figure 1). The data to be displayed is selected by choosing a signal group; these groups can be configured using the [Signal List](../../signal-views/signal-list.md) or [Signal Plot](../../signal-views/signal-plot.md) features of Vehicle Spy. The divider between the signal descriptions and values can be moved by clicking and dragging.

The Grid control contains the common properties found under [Common Control Properties](graphical-panel-controls-common-control-properties.md), as well as the additional properties shown in Table 1.
