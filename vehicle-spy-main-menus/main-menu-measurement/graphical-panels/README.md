# Graphical Panels

Vehicle Spy's Graphical Panels view allows the creation of custom user interfaces. A number of different tools can be added to each panel, including graphs, bargraphs, transmit buttons, drop-down boxes, test buttons, meters, knobs, LEDs/lights, text displays, and numeric entry boxes. You can create as many graphical panels as you like, and float them so they will always be visible within Vehicle Spy.

Each tool can be resized and moved anywhere on the panel. A group of tools can also be easily selected and aligned. After setting up a panel, it can be locked in place to avoid tools being accidentally moved while in use.

One person can create a set of graphical panels and distribute them to others. For example, a veteran Vehicle Spy user can create easy-to-use panels for colleagues who may have little or no experience with the software.

Graphical Panels can be accessed through the **Measurement** menu (Figure 1).
