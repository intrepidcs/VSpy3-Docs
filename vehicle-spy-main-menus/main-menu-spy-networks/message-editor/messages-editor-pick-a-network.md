# Messages Editor: Pick a Network

Each [Network](../networks/) has different [Messages and Signals](./). The Network the Messages Editor table is referring to is specified by the **On Network** drop down located at the top of Messages Editor view (Figure 1). Changing this dropdown will show the messages for this network.

The ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/netbranch.gif) icon identifies networks with messages in the Receive, Transmit, or Database table. Networks that do not have that symbol, do not have any message defined.
