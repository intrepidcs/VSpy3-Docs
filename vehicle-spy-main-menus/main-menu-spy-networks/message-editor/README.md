# Message Editor

Vehicle communications involve networks of ECUs (or nodes) exchanging messages filled with signals. Network Databases are applied to each physical network to organize all of that data being exchanged.\
\
The Messages Editor provides a spreadsheet view of the network databases currently being applied to the networks. The editor also supports the creation of databases containing Receive and Transmit messages and signals.\
\
All messages and signals identified in the Messages Editor are visible in the Messages view. Once identified, these messages and signals can also be accessed for filters, function blocks, graphs, and other features via the Expression Builder.
