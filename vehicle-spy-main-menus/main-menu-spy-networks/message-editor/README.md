# Message Editor

Vehicle communications involve [networks](../networks/) of ECUs (or nodes) exchanging messages filled with signals. Network Databases are applied to each physical network to organize all of that data being exchanged.\
\
The [Messages Editor](messages-editor-overview.md) provides a spreadsheet view of the network databases currently being applied to the networks. The editor also supports the creation of databases containing [Receive and Transmit](messages-editor-receive-transmit-and-database-tables.md) messages and signals.\
\
All messages and [signals](message-signals/) identified in the Messages Editor are visible in the [Messages](../messages-view/) view. Once identified, these messages and signals can also be accessed for filters, function blocks, graphs, and other features via the [Expression Builder](../../../shared-features-in-vehicle-spy/shared-features-expression-builder.md).
