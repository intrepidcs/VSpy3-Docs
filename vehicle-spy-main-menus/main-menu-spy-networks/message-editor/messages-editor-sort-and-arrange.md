# Messages Editor: Sort and Arrange

It is easy to sort and arrange messages in Messages Editor view.

You can sort [Messages](./) alphabetically by clicking the A-Z sort button (![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/aZsort.gif)) on the Messages Editor toolbar (Figure 1). The sort is based on the column currently selected.

For example, if the description field is selected and press A-Z sort, the messages will be sorted alphabetically by description. If the [Arb ID](messages-editor-message-fields/message-arbitration-id.md) column is selected and click A-Z sort, the messages will be sorted numerically by arbitration ID.

It is also possible to change message order without reordering the entire message list. Select a message and use the arrow buttons (Figure 2) to move the message up or down, one row at a time, through the list.
