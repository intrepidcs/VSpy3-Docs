# Add and Delete Messages

To create a new transmit or receive message definition click the **+ button** (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)) and a new blank message will be added to the bottom of the messages spreadsheet.\
\
If there are more messages than needed in the spreadsheet, they can easily be removed. To delete a message, simply select a message and press the - **button** (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smTwo.gif)). A group of messages can also be deleted in this way. While holding **Shift**, **** left click to select a group then choose the delete button to remove them.\
\
**Note:** Vehicle Spy must be stopped to delete any messages.\
\
Any delete operation can be undone by clicking the **Undo Arrow** button (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smThree.gif)). These operations are also available from the Messages Editor Right-Click Menu.
