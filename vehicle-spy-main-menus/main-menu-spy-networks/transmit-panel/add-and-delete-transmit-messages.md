# Add and Delete Transmit Messages

Add or delete transmit messages in the Tx Panel by using the Transmit table of the [Messages Editor](../message-editor/messages-editor-overview.md). Use the **Edit Transmit Messages** button (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)) as a quick way to get there.
