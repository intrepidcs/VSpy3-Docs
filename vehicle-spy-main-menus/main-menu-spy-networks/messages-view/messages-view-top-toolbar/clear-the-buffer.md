# Clear the Buffer

Clear the [Messages view](../) buffer by pressing the **Erase** button on the Messages view [top toolbar](./) (Figure 1).Tapping [predefined function key](../../../../shared-features-in-vehicle-spy/shared-features-predefined-function-keys.md) **F3 then C** will also work.\
\
Clearing the buffer also resets the [buffer progress display](../messages-view-buffer-display/buffer-progress-display.md) and removes any suppression of activity highlighting caused by the [Reverse Engineering button](reverse-engineering.md).\
\
**Caution**: Clearing the Vehicle Spy message buffer is immediate and cannot be undone!
