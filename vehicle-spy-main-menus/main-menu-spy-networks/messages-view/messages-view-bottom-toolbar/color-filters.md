# Color Filters

The messages shown in [Messages view](../) can be colored according to user preference. This feature is another way to filter or differentiate messages.

Message coloring can be based on an individual message setting or a network setting.

For example, with the network setting, you could color all J1850 messages blue and CAN messages red. See the [Messages Editor](../../message-editor/messages-editor-message-fields/message-color.md) and [Networks](../../../main-menu-setup/setup-a-network.md) topics for information on how to assign colors.

Quickly change color modes by using the color filter buttons located in the [bottom toolbar](./) of Messages view (Figure 1). The button on the left is the Message coloring, while the one on the right is for Network coloring.
