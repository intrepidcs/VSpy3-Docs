# Options: Regional Settings

The [Tools](../) -> [Options](./) -> Regional Settings tab controls the format of the [Messages view column](../../main-menu-spy-networks/messages-view/messages-view-column-headers.md) called "RTC Time". The RTC Time is a Real Time Clock stamp put onto each message, assuming the connected hardware supports an RTC.

Changes to these settings also affect those found on the [Advanced Extractor Options](../utilities-extract-export/utilities-extract-from-sd-card.md), Regional Settings tab.
