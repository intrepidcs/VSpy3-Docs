# Utilities: Extract / Export

The [Tools](../) -> [Utilities](../tools-utilities/) -> Extract Export interface extracts data from [standalone logger](../../../application-notes/application-note-vehiclescape-standalone-logging/) SD cards and exports that data to various file formats. Those two functions are divided into two major areas, each with its own tab, as shown in Figure 1.\
\
The [Extract Tab](utilities-extract-from-sd-card.md) reads Vehicle Spy Archive (VSA) files from the SD card and converts them into Vehicle Spy Binary (VSB) files on the PC.\
\
The [Export Tab](utilities-export-vsb-to-other-formats.md) reads the extracted VSB files and converts them into various other signal or message file formats.
