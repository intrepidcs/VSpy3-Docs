### 2. Select Logon Name:

Vehicle Spy uses logon names to set up a default location for data files and setup files. As a new user, a new logon name must be created. Simply click the **+** button next to the **Logon Name** dropdown (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)). Enter name or other label and select **OK**.

### 3. Load the Vehicle Spy Setup File:
