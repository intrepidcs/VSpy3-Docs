# Part 5 - Summary

Congratulations on completing the tutorial! Now it is possible to go online. Once **MS CAN Playback** from the **Graphical Panel** has been turned on, transmitted MS CAN traffic can be seen. With this file, it is possible to take a capture from an ECU and simulate that ECU's traffic on a real BUS.

Before moving on to more complicated topics, take a moment or two to complete the following exercises. Putting new skills into practice immediately will help to reinforce what has been learned.

Exercises:

1\. Try creating another Playback Function Block that uses log data that you've captured, and that starts with the MS CAN Playback.\
\*Hint: No extra Script Function Blocks are necessary.

2\. Try experimenting with other Function Block Steps to get a feel for what can be done with scripting.
