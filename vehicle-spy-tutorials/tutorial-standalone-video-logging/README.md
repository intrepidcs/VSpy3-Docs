# Tutorial: Standalone Video Logging

### Overview

Logging video can be an incredibly powerful tool when used simultaneously with other types of logged traffic. From the ability to monitor tell-tales on the dashboard of a vehicle to verifying a certain module is physically actuating as it should, utilizing video can be crucial to any automotive project. In this example, video data will be collected from an AXIS network camera using VehicleScape DAQ. Before getting to that, there is a list of requirements that should be met:

* AXIS IP Camera
* neoVI Device capable of logging over ethernet
* Ethernet Cable
* Ethernet to USB adapter (Needed if you cannot connect to your camera over your PC's network interface)
* [AXIS IP Utility](https://www.axis.com/support/tools/axis-ip-utility)

Once everything on the list has been verified, continue to the tutorial.
