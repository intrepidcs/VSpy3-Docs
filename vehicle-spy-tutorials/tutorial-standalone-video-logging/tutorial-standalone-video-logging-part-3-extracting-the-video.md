### 3. Extract and export data

Extract and export the data according to the needs of the project. For information on how to do this, refer to the [Standalone Logging tutorial](../tutorial-simple-standalone-logging/). Finally, click on 'View Output Directory' (Figure 4 ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/1.gif)) and open the folder containing the extracted data.

In the Extracted Data folder, click on Video, then on Cam\_X (X will be the number you assigned to 192.168.2.X), then on AVI. This is the final video from the logged video. From here, the video can be edited, saved, or whatever is required for the project.
