### 1. Navigate to options:

The first part of setting up multiple devices is enabling the setting. Once Vehicle Spy is open, click the **Tools** button at the top and select **Options** from the drop down menu.

### 2. Check Selected Devices:

Make sure the menu is on the **Spy Networks** tab (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)) and then check the "**Selected Devices**" bubble (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smTwo.gif)) to enable the **Select Devices** button (Figure 1:![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smThree.gif)).
