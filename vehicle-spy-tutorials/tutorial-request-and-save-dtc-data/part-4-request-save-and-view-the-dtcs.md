# Part 4 - Request, Save, and View the DTCs

### 1. Put the Panel to Work:

To use this example, connect the attached hardware to a vehicle or ECU with a HSCAN network and start Vehicle Spy by pressing the **Play** button. Click the button on the graphical panel to start the function block that was created. The LED should change color. When it changes back, the collected data is saved to a file.

### 2. View the Saved Data:

Now that data is collected, where is it? Click on the ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/data.gif) button in the upper right corner. Windows Explorer opens showing the data folder for the Logon Name that was select in Part 1. The file saved in the data folder will have the name of the diagnostic service followed by the date and time. An example would be "Request DTCs from all nodes 9-04-2015 3-18-00 am.csv". Excel or other spreadsheet editors will open this type of file.
