# Tutorial: Getting Fancy with Diagnostics

### Overview

This tutorial explains how some diagnostic services can work together to expand their functionality.

The scenarios that will be covered in this example are:

* Write Identifier from Read Data by Identifier
* Read Dynamic Identifier created with Dynamically Define Data Identifier

This example assumes that the previous examples have been completed and some basic knowledge of ISO 14229 Diagnostics is known. A vehicle or bench will be helpful but is not necessary. The important things to understand are the concepts presented.

Before moving to the next step, please create a platform and import the 'Getting Fancy with Diagnostics.odx' file to a new ECU. For instructions on how to do this, please see the 'Database Setup' tutorial here.
