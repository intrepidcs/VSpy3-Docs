# Part 3 - Loading the Script to the Hardware

### 1. CoreMini Console:

The CoreMini Console is found under 'Tools'. This is where scripts can be loaded or removed from the hardware.

### 2. Using CoreMini Console:

The CoreMini Console has a lot of information regarding the setup that is to be transferred. (Figure2: ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smOne.gif)) shows the output list. This list will notify you of any errors or warnings. If any problems exist in the script, a red dot will be next to that item to warn you that something is wrong. The "Send to USB Device" section marked by (Figure2: ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smTwo.gif))lets you setup where to send the script. The Device section selects which of the connected hardware to send the script to. The Storage section lets you choose where to store the script. For Playback and Capture scripts, the"SD Card" must be used. The "Run CoreMini After Download"checkbox (Figure2: ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smThree.gif))tells the hardware if it should run the script after it is loaded. If this is unchecked, the script will not run until the unit is re-powered. The Send button (Figure2: ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smFour.gif)) will send the script to the hardware.

### 3. Clearing Scripts from Memory:

Scripts can be removed from the hardware by using the Clear button (Figure2: ![](https://cdn.intrepidcs.net/support/VehicleSpy/assets/smFive.gif)). Once a script has been removed from the hardware, the script must be sent to the hardware again in order to run it.
