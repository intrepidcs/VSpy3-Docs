# Part 7 - Conclusion

### Overview

The following steps were taken to capture data.

1. Create a J1979 RPM Request.
2. Create a function block to log data.
3. Load the CoreMini to the hardware.
4. Extract the data.
5. Review the collected data.

This was meant to be a simple example. There is much more that can be done using CoreMini in supported hardware. A simple script Function Block can be created and used to simulate functions of an ECU or request diagnostic data. Captures can be configured to log during set conditions or inputs.
