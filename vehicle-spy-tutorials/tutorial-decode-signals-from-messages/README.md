# Tutorial: Decode Signals from Messages

### Overview

Many network messages contain information called signals. Two categories of signals that a message can contain are analog and digital. Digital information can be thought of as yes/no, on/off, or open/closed. Things such as lights on/off and door open/closed fall into this category. Analog information, on the other hand, is not limited to two simple states, it is variable. When thinking of analog information, think of vehicle speed, engine RPM, coolant temperature, or anything else with variable values.

In Tutorial 3 there will be the opportunity to extract or decode analog signals with Vehicle Spy. Decoding digital signals is done basically the same way, so this tutorial applies to that as well.
