# Part 4 - Use the DPS Programming Graphical Panel

### Put the Panel to Work

To use this example, connect the attached hardware to a vehicle or to the ECUs to program and start Vehicle Spy. Click the button on the graphical panel to start the function block that was created. A few windows from DPS may pop up on the screen. Vehicle Spy will take care of these screens and close them when it is done with them. The graphical panel components added should display the progress and log information from the programming events. When the first ECU is done, the second one will start programming.
