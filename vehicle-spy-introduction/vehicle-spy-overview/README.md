# Vehicle Spy Overview

### The Automotive Electronics Engineering Tool for Networked Vehicles.

Vehicle Spy is a world class engineering tool for designing, testing, and analyzing networked vehicles of today and tomorrow.

Electronics in the Vehicle has grown to an unprecedented level of complexity, from a handful of computers just a decade ago to literally dozens of computers situated in an in-vehicle computer network.

Further increasing complexity is the inclusion of multiple networks including main networks, sub-networks, and multimedia networks with gateways in between them. This newfound complexity makes development and verification of vehicle electronics systems a difficult challenge.

Vehicle Spy tackles this challenge head on with a focus on ease-of-use and user productivity. Vehicle Spy software contains many tools to help users access information quickly.

### Examples of Ways to Use Vehicle Spy

* **Bus Analyzer** - simultaneously monitor all network message transmissions.
* **Flight Recorder** - automatically capture bus events and store buffer files.
* **Node Simulator** - simulate missing nodes, gateways, or entire vehicles.
* **Flash/Diagnostics Tool** - flash ECU software, read/write memory locations, or read trouble codes.
