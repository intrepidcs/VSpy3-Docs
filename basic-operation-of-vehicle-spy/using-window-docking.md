# Using Window Docking

Another way to see more than on window at a time in Vehicle Spy is to use the window docking feature. With this feature, views can be placed where they will be the most useful.

Tearing and Docking Tabs (Figure 1): Tabs in Vehicle Spy can be "torn off" or removed from the main window. This comes in handy when needing to see a number of different view at the same time or if different windows on different parts of the screen would be helpful. Tabs are removed from the main window by clicking on the tab or view and dragging the view away.

Tabs that are removed can be put back or placed in other views. This is done by clicking and dragging on the view's title bar and moving it towards the view to dock it to. When the view gets close to another view, a dock option will appear. Moving the mouse over the dock option will snap it to the other view. The highlighted area is where the view will go if the mouse button is released. To prevent docking the view but allow it to move it elsewhere, hold Ctrl on the keyboard while dragging.
